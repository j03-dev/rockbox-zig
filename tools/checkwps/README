This directory contains the checkwps tool which can be used to
validate wps files outside of Rockbox.

checkwps uses the Rockbox WPS parser and is therefore built in
target-specific versions (to avoid making lots of changes to the core
code).

To compile
----------

Just run the ./buildall.sh script

To remove all compiled files
----------------------------

./cleanall.sh

To add a new target
-------------------

No action necessary, list of targets is parsed out of the configure script
